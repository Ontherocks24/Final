    <h1>Behind The Mask</h1>
    <h2>By Caleb McCaskie</h2>
    <p>This project was a look into the everyday lives of people. Once we are out and on the go it may be hard to tell how someone really feels, but once we are alone our true emotions come out. That is what this series of pictures is about.</p>
